## Features

1. **Local Storage**  
   Your data is securely stored in your browser's local storage. This means your tasks won't be lost even if you close or refresh the browser.

2. **Light & Dark Theme**  
   Choose between light and dark themes to match your preferences and ensure a comfortable user experience.

3. **Daily Countdown & Task Timer**

4. **"Eat the Frog First" Strategy**  
   Inspired by Brian Tracy's productivity concept in _Eat That Frog_, this feature encourages you to tackle your most challenging and important task firstâ€”the one you're most likely to procrastinate on. If this option is selected, the app will automatically prioritize and move your most critical task to the top of your to-do list.
